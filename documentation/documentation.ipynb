    "## 8-Puzzle Solver: Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The 8-Puzzle problem is a classic sliding tile puzzle that consists of a 3x3 grid with 8 numbered tiles and one empty space. The objective is to rearrange the tiles from a random initial configuration to match the goal state:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal State:**\n",
    "1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 0\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives:\n",
    "1. **Random Board Generation**: Generate 100 random, solvable puzzle configurations.\n",
    "2. **Solvability Check**: Verify that the generated boards are solvable.\n",
    "3. **Heuristic Comparison**: Evaluate and compare the performance of two heuristics:\n",
    "   - **Hamming Distance**: Counts the number of misplaced tiles.\n",
    "   - **Manhattan Distance**: Measures the total distance tiles must move to reach their goal positions.\n",
    "4. **Performance Metrics**:\n",
    "   - Measure **memory effort** (number of nodes expanded during search).\n",
    "   - Measure **execution time** for solving each puzzle.\n",
    "5. **Statistical Analysis**: Calculate the mean and standard deviation of memory usage and execution time for each heuristic across 100 test cases.\n",
    "6. **Code Modularity and Documentation**:\n",
    "   - Implement a modular and well-documented Python solution using the **A\\* search algorithm**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deliverables:\n",
    "- A Python-based implementation of the 8-Puzzle solver.\n",
    "- Performance evaluation and comparison of two heuristics: Hamming and Manhattan.\n",
    "- Statistical insights into memory usage and execution time.\n",
    "- Clear and modular code with inline comments and explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project demonstrates the effectiveness of different heuristics in solving the 8-Puzzle problem and provides insights into their computational complexity and efficiency.\n"

    "## Software Architecture Diagram\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description:\n",
    "The 8-Puzzle Solver project follows a modular architecture. Each component is implemented as an independent module to promote reusability, readability, and maintainability. The system is structured into the following key layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**:\n",
    "   - **`main.py`**: Entry point for running the program. It initializes random boards, applies heuristics, and collects performance statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Core Logic**:\n",
    "   - **`board.py`**:\n",
    "     - Manages board representation, validation, and operations (e.g., random board generation, checking solvability).\n",
    "   - **`solver.py`**:\n",
    "     - Implements the A\\* search algorithm.\n",
    "     - Integrates heuristic functions for efficient pathfinding.\n",
    "   - **`heuristics.py`**:\n",
    "     - Contains implementations of Hamming and Manhattan heuristics.\n",
    "   - **`utils.py`**:\n",
    "     - Provides helper functions for reconstructing paths, generating neighbors, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Testing Layer**:\n",
    "   - **`tests/`**: Includes unit tests for all modules (board, heuristics, solver, and utility functions).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Experimentation and Documentation**:\n",
    "   - **`experiment/puzzle8_experiment.ipynb`**:\n",
    "     - Jupyter Notebook for testing, visualization, and performance evaluation.\n",
    "   - **`documentation/`**:\n",
    "     - Contains detailed descriptions, diagrams, and analysis of the project.\n",

    "## Design Decisions: Why This Structure Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to emphasize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "   - Each module is responsible for one specific part of the system (e.g., board logic, solving logic, heuristics).\n",
    "   - This avoids interdependencies, making it easier to debug, test, and modify individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - New features (e.g., additional heuristics or algorithms) can be added with minimal changes to existing code.\n",
    "   - The design supports \"plug-and-play\" functionality, where components like heuristics or solver logic are interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - Common operations (e.g., generating neighbors, reconstructing paths) are abstracted into utilities, reducing duplication.\n",
    "   - Components like the board and solver can be reused in different contexts or extended for other grid-based puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing and Experimentation**:\n",
    "   - The modular structure makes unit testing straightforward, as each module can be tested independently.\n",
    "   - The use of a Jupyter Notebook for experimentation allows rapid iteration, performance analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Readability and Organization**:\n",
    "   - Dividing the code into logical files improves readability and ensures that each file has a clear purpose.\n",
    "   - This reduces cognitive load for developers working on the project, whether for debugging or adding new features.\n",
