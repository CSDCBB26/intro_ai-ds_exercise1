    "## Design Decisions: Why This Structure Works\n",
    "\n",
    "The project is designed to emphasize:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Separation of Concerns**:\n",
    "   - Each module is responsible for one specific part of the system (e.g., board logic, solving logic, heuristics).\n",
    "   - This avoids interdependencies, making it easier to debug, test, and modify individual components.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Extensibility**:\n",
    "   - New features (e.g., additional heuristics or algorithms) can be added with minimal changes to existing code.\n",
    "   - The design supports \"plug-and-play\" functionality, where components like heuristics or solver logic are interchangeable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Reusability**:\n",
    "   - Common operations (e.g., generating neighbors, reconstructing paths) are abstracted into utilities, reducing duplication.\n",
    "   - Components like the board and solver can be reused in different contexts or extended for other grid-based puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Testing and Experimentation**:\n",
    "   - The modular structure makes unit testing straightforward, as each module can be tested independently.\n",
    "   - The use of a Jupyter Notebook for experimentation allows rapid iteration, performance analysis, and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Readability and Organization**:\n",
    "   - Dividing the code into logical files improves readability and ensures that each file has a clear purpose.\n",
    "   - This reduces cognitive load for developers working on the project, whether for debugging or adding new features.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discussion and Conclusions\n",
    "## Possible Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parallel Processing**:\n",
    "   - Optimize performance by exploring parallel processing for tasks like neighbor generation or evaluating heuristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Error Handling and Logging**:\n",
    "   - Improve error handling for invalid inputs edge cases and add logging for debugging and performance tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Graphical User Interface (GUI)**:\n",
    "   - Develop a simple GUI to visualize the board states, solution steps, and solver performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Experience\n",
    "This project is a hands-on experience with implementing and testing the **A\\* search algorithm** for solving the 8-Puzzle problem. Key takeaways include:\n",
    "### Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "During the development of this project, we found that the modular design of the code was crucial in ensuring that individual components could be tested and extended independently. This approach made debugging easier and allowed us to focus on refining specific parts of the program without affecting the overall system. Additionally, we observed the significant role heuristics play in the A* algorithm, particularly their impact on both memory usage and execution time. Handling edge cases, such as detecting unsolvable boards, further strengthened the robustness of the implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "There were some challenges we encountered throughout the process. One of the key difficulties was finding the right balance between optimizing performance and maintaining clarity in the heuristic calculations. Another challenge was generating and analyzing meaningful performance metrics for 100 random boards.\n",
